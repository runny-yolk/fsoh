# five seconds of hell
This app listens to twitter for 5 seconds, and then shows you the result, along with a couple of other things. Check it out at http://five-seconds-of-hell.herokuapp.com

The app is built using NodeJS, Express, and ReactJS, and the comments within assume good knowledge of all 3, although you can google stuff you don't know.
