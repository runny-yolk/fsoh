# five seconds of hell
This app listens to twitter for 5 seconds, and then shows you the result, along with a couple of other things. Check it out at http://five-seconds-of-hell.herokuapp.com

The app is built using NodeJS, Express, and ReactJS, and the comments within assume good knowledge of all 3, although you can google stuff you don't know.

I created this project to learn ReactJS, specifically being able to create reasonably snappy and presentable interfaces, with animations, based off of large datasets. Twitter's public tweet stream (statuses/sample) seemed a good thing to use to achieve this. After a short time messing around with this, I realised it was much like staring into the abyss, and so I named it five seconds of hell, and added a humourous flair to the text on the site.
